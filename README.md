## Appliance energy consumption prediction and classification using federated learning

This repository uses federated learning (FL) to: \
(i) train a model that can predict the energy consumption of appliances in a household, and \
(ii) train another model that can classify the type of electricity appliances according to their energy consumption recordings.

To run this repository on Google Colab, you can do so [here!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fredrikofstad/FL-Appliance-Energy-Prediction-and-Classification/blob/master/src/fl-notebook.ipynb)
